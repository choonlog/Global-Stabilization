# Global-stabilization
This software is for implementing simulations of 'Global stabilization' that steers towards an unspecified fixed point in Boolean networks. It is actually close to a simulator to find attractors and a interpretor of JSON file including information about attractors that is extracted from a simulator.

We developed it based on [BooleaSim](https://github.com/jehoons/BooleanSim) that is pytython 3 package for finding attractors in Boolean network and was developed by jehoons.
