# Global-stabilization
This software is for implementing simulations of 'Global stabilization' that steers towards an unspecified fixed point in Boolean networks. It is actually close to a simulator to find attractors and a interpretor of JSON file including information about attractors that is extracted from a simulator.

We developed it based on [BooleaSim](https://github.com/jehoons/BooleanSim) that is pytython 3 package for finding attractors in Boolean network and was developed by jehoons.

# Install
* BooleanSim

⋅⋅⋅Download BooleaSim
cd BooleanSim 
python setup.py install 

* FVS
⋅⋅⋅[FVS finder](https://github.com/needleworm/fvs)

* Stable motifs

4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
