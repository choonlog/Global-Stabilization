# Global-stabilization
This software is for implementing simulations of 'Global stabilization' that steers towards an unspecified fixed point in Boolean networks. It is actually close to a simulator to find attractors and a interpretor of JSON file including information about attractors to analize that easily.

'Booleasim' is a package for finding attractors and was developed by jehoons.
We used a Booleansim python 3 package that is for finding attractors. It was developed by Jehoons.
One who wants to use this software need to install Booleansim package first and then can implements some simulations for 'Global stabilization'
